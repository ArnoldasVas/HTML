      HTML tags on text arrangement, style, color. Design a page which looks
      like the text givenbelow.

    <h1>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h1>
    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
    <hr />
    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px"><b>header size</b></p>
    <p>
      and <span style="color: blue"> color </span>
      <span style="color: red"> of </span>
      <span style="color: green">letters</span> seen on the screen. The
      <span style="font-size: xx-large">font size</span> can be changed aswell,
      and actually gives more choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some
      differingword types in a blocked quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now is the <i>time</i> for all good <b>people</b> to <b>come</b> to the
      <i>aid</i> of their country.
    </p>
    <p>That was also an example of a nested command.</p>
